# RedTyp
Computational Database for Reduplication

RedTyp is an SQL database of morpho-phonologically reduplicative processes and their corresponding computational implementation: 2-way finite-state transducers.

The utility of the database is twofold:

1) It provides a representative typology of reduplication in natural language, a cross-linguistically common but understudied topic in computational linguistics.

2) It provides a computational implementation for the typology of reduplication using 2-way finite-state transducers (2-way FSTs).

Computational morphologists can utilize our database to retrieve computational models for both common and uncommon reduplicative processes. 

Typological morphologists can utilize our database to get a rough picture on the typology of reduplication. 

More information on how 2-way FSTs work can be found in Filiot & Reynier (2016, "Transducers, logic and algebra for functions of finite words").

More information can be found in Dolatian & Heinz 2019 ["RedTyp: A Database of Reduplication with Computational Models"](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/scil/vol2/iss1/3/).



This repository contains the following  files:
1. An SQL file "RedTyp.sql" which is a copy of the SQL database, RedTyp.
2. A Python file "two_way_interpreter.py" which can interpret the 2-way FST recipes that are found in RedTyp.
3. A markdown file "README.md" which is the README file.
4. A license file "LICENSE.md".
5. A markdown file "instructions_on_recipe_creation.md" which has instructions on how to read and create 2-way FST recipes that can be interpreted by our Python interpreter.

The SQL database was created with phpmyadmin and it can imported into any SQL server, such as the open-source [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) system.

The Python file is written in Python 3.0.

# Installing and running RedTyp

To see how the SQL database models and implements reduplication using 2-way FSTs, do the following steps:

1. Import the SQL file into an SQL server, such as the open-source [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) system.

```bash
 $ mysql -u root -p
 
 mysql> create database redtyp;
 Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> exit

$ mysql redtyp < RedTyp.sql
```

2. Run the following SQL query to get a list of all morphemes that have been modeled so far. The query will return the morpheme's language, its semantic function, and its default shape (initial CV, initial CVC, etc.)

~~~~sql
SELECT `morphemes`.`language`,`morphemes`.`function`,`morphemes`.`default form name`
FROM `morphemes` 
~~~~

3. The above step will return a list of morphemes. For exmaple, the first entry is:

>>		Agta 	diminutive   	Initial C

4. If you want to run the 2-way FST for initial C reduplication in Agta, then you first need to get the 2-way FST recipe for initial C reduplication.
Do to so, run the following query.		
 
~~~~sql
SELECT `2-way FST`.`FST recipe`
FROM `morphemes`,`matches`,`2-way FST`
WHERE `matches`.`morpheme ID`=`morphemes`.`morpheme ID` AND `matches`.`2-way FST ID`=`2-way FST`.`2-way FST ID` AND `morphemes`.`language`="Agta" AND `morphemes`.`function`="diminutive" AND `morphemes`.`default form name`="Initial C";
~~~~

This returns the "2-way FST recipe" attribute for Agta initial-C reduplication.
The last three conditions in the above WHERE statement can be replaced with any other triple of "language", "function", and "default form name" that the user retrieved from step 3	

5. Given the "2-way	FST recipe" attribute from step 4, copy and save its value as a textfile "FST_recipe.txt". The name can be changed.

6. The user must create a textfile "input_strings.txt" which contains input strings for the 2-way FST which will be implemented. The name can be changed. This textfile must be encoded with either ANSI or utf-8.
Some 2-way FST recipes require that the input strings have whitespaces that separate between segments. This is the case when the function of the 2-way FST works over mutlicharacter symbols. The user must read the "Initial comments" section of the 2-way FST recipe file in order to check if this is so.
The "instructions_on_recipe_creation.txt" file provides more details on how to read 2-way FST recipes in the next section.
For example for Agta initial-C reduplication, the 2-way FST recipe doesn't require that input symbols be separated by whitespace. The "input_strings.txt" can contain the following:

>>pata\
patak\
apata\
taka

7. Place the textfiles "FST_recipe.txt" and "input_strings.txt" in the same folder as the python code "two_way_interpreter.py". 

8. In order to run the 2-way FST in the "FST_recipe.txt" file, open the terminal or commandline, and run the following line of code:

		python3 two_way_interpreter.py FST_recipe.txt input_strings.txt 'w'
		
9. The terminal will create the following textfiles: "output_transitions.txt" and "output_strings.txt". The file "output_transitions.txt" contains a list of transition arcs for the 2-way FST. This is not written in shorthand.
The file "output_strings.txt" shows the output of each of the input strings in "input_strings.txt". In case the 2-way FST was not defined for some input string, the reason  why the 2-way FST failed is indicated. For example for the "input_strings.txt" that was run, "output_strings.txt" contains the following:

>>pata	-->	pa\~pata\
pataka	-->	pa\~pataka\
apata	-->	 --- there was an error because couldn't find output state for the input state+input symbol pair (output first C,a)\
taka	-->	ta~taka

10. Users can also create their own 2-way FSTs by writing a list of initial states, final states, and transition arcs as in "output_transitions.txt". To illustrate, rename "output_transitions.txt" to "test_transitions.txt". Open the terminal or commandline, and run the following line of code:

		python3 two_way_interpreter.py test_transitions.txt input_strings.txt 'r'
